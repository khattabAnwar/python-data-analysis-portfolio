# Python Data Analysis Portfolio

This is a **sample data analysis project** built using **Python**, **pandas**, and **matplotlib**.  
The goal is to demonstrate my skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Dataset
- Randomly generated sales dataset with 100 rows.
- Columns include:
  - Item Type
  - Sales Channel
  - Order Priority
  - Order Date
  - Order ID
  - Ship Date
  - Units Sold
  - Unit Price
  - Unit Cost
  - Total Revenue
  - Total Cost
  - Total Profit

## Analysis Performed
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
   - Converted dates to datetime
   - Checked for missing or incorrect values
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
   - Total Profit, Average Unit Price
   - Most common Sales Channel
3. Visualizations
   - **Bar chart**: Total Profit by Sales Channel
   - **Line chart**: Units Sold Over Time
   - **Pie chart**: Order Priority Distribution

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python programming
- Data manipulation with **pandas**
- Data visualization with **matplotlib**
- Basic business analysis

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have **Python 3**, **pandas**, and **matplotlib** installed
2. Place `sample_sales_100.csv` in the same folder as the script
3. Run `python main.py` in your terminal or PyCharm
4. Visualizations will be displayed and can also be saved as images
